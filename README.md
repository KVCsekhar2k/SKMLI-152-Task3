Health Disorder Predictor Using Machine Learning

 Overview
This project aims to implement a robust machinelearning model that predicts diseases based on the symptoms exhibited by an individual. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the model identifies patterns in symptom data to make accurate predictions about potential health disorders.

 Key Features
 Data Collection: Gather comprehensive datasets containing symptoms and corresponding disease diagnoses.
 Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and normalize features.
 Model Selection: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms suited for multiclass classification tasks.
 Model Training: Train the selected model using the prepared dataset to learn associations between symptoms and diseases.
 Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1score.
 Prediction: Implement a mechanism to input symptoms and obtain predictions about potential health disorders.
 Deployment: Deploy the trained model for realtime prediction of diseases based on symptoms.
